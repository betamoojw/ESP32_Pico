ESP32 Pico D4 project with 0.66" Oled Display
This design was an experiment using new parts like the ESP32 Pico D4, 14500 LiPo battery, 1mmx1mm RGB led and a metal wifi\bluetooth antenna. It can be powered off of a battery or USB cable. If a battery is inserted and USB cable are pluggin in it will charge the battery and power the board. This project was not created for any specific purpose but just an excuse to test out a fe wnew parts. if you come up with an idea for this hardware then just let me know at @mikerankin
